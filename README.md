# Malware Classification with Machine Learning

## Description
Welcome to the Malware Classification with Machine Learning project! This repository contains code and resources for building and evaluating machine learning models to classify malware samples using a dataset of known malware and benign files. The primary goal of this project is to develop accurate classifiers for identifying malicious software.

## Key Features
- **Malware Dataset:** We provide a curated dataset of malware samples and benign files for training and evaluation. This dataset is regularly updated to ensure relevance and diversity.
- **Classifier Comparison:** We implement a variety of machine learning classifiers, including RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, SGDClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, GaussianNB, to compare their performance in malware classification.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Extensive data preprocessing techniques are employed to clean, transform, and extract meaningful features from the raw data, ensuring that the classifiers receive high-quality input.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** The project includes a thorough evaluation of classifier performance using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves. This helps in understanding the trade-offs between true positives, false positives, and overall model performance.
- **Cross-Validation:** To mitigate overfitting and improve model generalization, we implement cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model's accuracy is reliable and not dependent on the specific train-test split.
- **Model Tuning:** Hyperparameter optimization and feature selection techniques are applied to enhance the model's performance and minimize false positives/negatives.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** We offer a user-friendly interface to train, test, and visualize the performance of different classifiers on your malware dataset.
